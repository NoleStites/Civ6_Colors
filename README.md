# Civ6_Colors
## Description
This repo contains a Python script that allows users to edit the main colors of leaders in the video game Sid Meier's Civilization VI. The mod currently supports base-game leaders and DLC content.

> It is important to note that this code edits the Civilization VI source code directly, namely the following files: `playerstandardcolors.xml` and `playercolors.xml`. **This program lets you safely undo any changes to regain the original source code**.

<!-- ![An example leader with colors changed](example_colors.png) -->
